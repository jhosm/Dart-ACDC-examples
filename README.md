# Dart ACDC Example

This project demonstrates how to use `dart_acdc` to instantly configure a production-ready HTTP client for an OpenAPI-generated SDK.

It showcases the **"Zero-Config"** philosophy: simply build a `Dio` instance with `dart_acdc` and inject it into your generated client to get free logging, error handling, and token management.

## Features Demonstrated

*   **Zero Boilerplate Setup**: Configuring `Dio` with `AcdcClientBuilder`.
*   **OpenAPI Integration**: Injecting the configured `Dio` into a client generated by `openapi-generator` (JSONPlaceholder API).
*   **Logging**: Automatic logging of requests/responses with configurable log levels.
*   **Error Handling**: catching `AcdcException` and standardizing error states.
*   **Web Support**: Running fully on the web (CORS-compatible).

## How to Run

### Web (Recommended)
This example uses the JSONPlaceholder API which supports CORS, making it easy to test in the browser.

```bash
cd example
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Mobile (iOS/Android)
Standard Flutter commands apply:

```bash
cd example
flutter run -d ios      # macOS only
flutter run -d android
```

## Project Structure

*   `lib/main.dart`: The Flutter app. Shows how to initialize `AcdcClientBuilder` and use the generated API.
*   `lib/api_client/`: A local package containing the Dart client code generated from `openapi/jsonplaceholder.json`.

## Re-generating the Client

If you modify the spec in `openapi/jsonplaceholder.json`, you can re-generate the client code:

1.  Install `openapi-generator`: `brew install openapi-generator`
2.  Run generation:
    ```bash
    openapi-generator generate -i openapi/jsonplaceholder.json -g dart-dio -o lib/api_client
    ```
3.  Rebuild serialization:
    ```bash
    cd lib/api_client
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
